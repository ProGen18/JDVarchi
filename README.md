# Game-of-life

This program was created by **TALAB StÃ©phane** as part of a computer architecture project, conducted during the 2024-2025 academic year in the second year of the Computer Science bachelor's degree at UPJV Amiens.

The project implements the famous **"Game of Life"**, designed by mathematician **John Horton Conway** in 1970. This cellular automaton is renowned for its fascinating emergent properties. The program is based on an implementation in 68k assembly language, a programming language that operates very close to the hardware.




## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to install the **EASy68k** software.

- **Link to download and install EASy68k** :

  [http://www.easy68k.com/](http://www.easy68k.com/)
## Installation

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ProGen18/JDVarchi
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd JDVarchi
```

Open Your Project File

```
- Launch the **EASy68k** application.
- Go to **File** > **Open** and select the `main.X68` file from the project folder.
```
Assemble the Code

```
Once your project file is opened, press **F9** to assemble the code. This will compile the assembly file into machine code.
```

Run the Program

```
After the assembly is finished, press **F5** to run the program and watch the **Game of Life** simulation within the EASy68k environment.
```
